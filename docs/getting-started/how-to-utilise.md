Composite actions within the repository are grouped by technology/domain-of-interest.

For example, actions under "Terraform" are intended to provide re-usable components
for interaction with Terraform.

It is thus intended that individuals will search for the action(s) of interest and review
their in-depth documentation there in order to utilise it within their workflows.

Release notes are also provided here in an easily digestible format.
