## About The Project

This project contains a setup of re-usable GitHub composition actions.

Specifically it is a library of [semantically versioned](https://semver.org) actions, intended to be used as off-the-shelf, standardised,
building blocks for CI/CD processes involving GitHub Actions.

In the instance that several of these composite actions, when combined, fulfill a use-case this is either done via:

- Direct instantiation in a caller repo
- As a re-usable workflow

It is recommended to begin with the Getting Started section, and then
to simply find the action(s) of interest via the nav bar to investigate them
further,.
